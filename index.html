            Hi! My name is Jordan Lyn, I'm a self-taught developer from
            Plaistow, London with a strong passion for web development. I'm
            working part-time as a security officer and self-studying using
            resources such as YouTube, Udemy, and information sites such as MDN
            and Medium Blog posts. I aspire to be a leader in this field with a
            set of varied unparalleled skills which I think is what it takes to
            become a fully-fledged developer.

            When I'm away from my keyboard I enjoy going to the gym, learning
            about animals and playing video games (not so AFK after all).

            <h3>structure</h3>
            <p>
              Being self-taught is fun because you tend to focus on the things
              that “just work”, I sometimes overlook the underlying reasons for
              why something works which tends to become a bump in the road later
              on down the line (immutability in React -.-). <br /><br />
              With structured learning, these overlooked aspects of programming
              are factored in, in some cases, I'm not fully aware of these
              topics which results in longer debugging sessions and having to
              perform extensive research on internet to find the answer to my
              dilemma(s). Having a structured curriculum and working on real
              issues also creates a stronger sense of urgency as there are set
              deadlines that have an impact. In contrast, being self-taught, you
              can offset certain tasks you have extreme difficulty with, with
              more manageable tasks.
            </p>

            <i class="fa fa-solid fa-people-group"></i>
            <h3>learn, experience, earn</h3>
            <p>
              Working another job and studying at the same time can be
              exhausting both mentally and physically, however, with an
              apprenticeship I get the best of both worlds with a focus on
              practical application for a real company.
              <br /><br />
              Learning as mentioned before is more structured which points you
              in the right direction, applying what you've learned to real-world
              applications makes the experience feel much more tangible. You're
              no longer a chicken, you're now a pig who has to commit themselves
              to ensure the best possible outcomes for the company you work for.
              Earning enhances this tangible feeling because it puts value on
              the work you produce, it feels much better than pretending to fix
              a real-world issue.
              <br /><br />
              This, in my opinion, is a good way gain recognition too: offering
              a network; being awarded a certificate upon completion; 1 to 1's
              with those who have more experience than you is always a plus.

            <h3>future</h3>
            <p>
              My aspirations as a developer are to help build the world of
              tomorrow, whether it's improving the visual appetite of the
              average user or inventing/integrating something as grand as
              improving the accessibility of technology/software for people
              around the world, I want to use my skills and intuition to improve
              the state of the world - the next generation as well as my own. I
              believe getting into the Software Foundation (and eventually an
              apprenticeship) is the stepping stone to my dream of becoming a
              part of the new world of technology with its accelerated growth.
              <br /><br />As a Web Developer I will be handling a big part of
              the media which comes with a level of responsibility to ensure the
              highest standards of visual interfaces and user experiences, I
              believe I will gain the necessary skills to achieve my dream by
              joining the Founders and Coders program.

            been practicing for 3 years. I use mainly Javascript as I started
            off learning about NodeJS and VueJS, but recently I have been
            focusing on ReactJS as a client library; I'm always excited to learn
