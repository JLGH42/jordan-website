      Hi! My name is Jordan Lyn, I'm a self-taught developer from Plaistow,
      London with a strong passion for web development. I'm working part-time as
      a security officer and self-studying using resources such as YouTube,
      Udemy, and information sites such as MDN and Medium Blog posts. I aspire
      to be a leader in this field with a set of varied unparalleled skills
      which I think is what it takes to become a fully-fledged developer.

      When I'm away from my keyboard I enjoy going to the gym, learning about
      animals and playing video games (not so AFK after all).
